This project was one of 2 programs created for a university assignment 

It will take the size (in bytes) of an item within the directory assigned to it in 'main.py', add that to the total size and then move onto the next item.

If the next item is a new directory, the function recurses and find the size of everything in the new directory path and then return to the parent path at the end.
